## Problem Statement

### **Celebrity Face Recognition and Classification System**

**Objective:** Develop a deep learning-based computer vision system that can accurately identify and classify celebrity faces from images into predefined categories (specific celebrities).

**Key Challenges:**
1. **Multi-class Classification:** Recognize faces of multiple celebrities from diverse images
2. **Real-world Variability:** Handle variations in:
   - Lighting conditions
   - Facial expressions
   - Pose and angles
   - Image quality and resolution
   - Occlusions and accessories

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- Contains images of multiple celebrities
- Each celebrity represents a separate class
- Images vary in size, quality, and background
- Potential class imbalance across different celebrities

**Technical Requirements:**
- Preprocess facial images for consistent model input
- Extract meaningful facial features for discrimination
- Build a robust classifier that generalizes well to unseen images
- Handle the computational challenges of image processing

**Expected Output:**
For a given input image containing a face, the system should:
1. Detect and extract the face region
2. Classify it into one of the predefined celebrity categories
3. Provide confidence scores for the prediction

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Classification accuracy
- Precision and recall per celebrity class
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Potentially F1-score for imbalanced data

**Applications:**
- Automated celebrity identification in media
- Content tagging and organization
- Entertainment industry analytics
- Security and authentication systems

The project demonstrates a practical implementation of computer vision techniques to solve a real-world multi-class image classification problem using celebrity faces as the domain-specific use case.
