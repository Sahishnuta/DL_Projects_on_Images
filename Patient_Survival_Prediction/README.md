## Problem Statement

**Predicting patient survival outcomes based on clinical and medical imaging data** to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions about patient care and treatment strategies.

## Key Problem Components:

### 1. **Core Objective**
- Develop a machine learning/deep learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient will survive based on their medical data
- Use both structured clinical data and medical images for comprehensive analysis

### 2. **Data Characteristics**
- **Multimodal data**: Combines tabular clinical data with medical images
- **Binary classification**: Survived (1) vs Not Survived (0)
- **Medical imaging component**: Likely includes X-rays, CT scans, or MRI images
- **Clinical features**: May include vital signs, lab results, demographic information

### 3. **Technical Approach**
Based on the project structure, the solution involves:
- **Data preprocessing** for both images and tabular data
- **Feature engineering** from medical images using CNNs
- **Ensemble methods** combining image features with clinical data
- **Deep learning models** for feature extraction and classification

## Business/Clinical Impact:

### **Significance:**
- **Early intervention**: Identify high-risk patients for proactive care
- **Resource allocation**: Optimize hospital resources and ICU bed management
- **Treatment planning**: Assist clinicians in making data-driven decisions
- **Risk stratification**: Classify patients based on survival probability

### **Challenges Addressed:**
1. **Data heterogeneity**: Integrating different data types (images + tabular)
2. **Class imbalance**: Common in medical datasets where survival rates vary
3. **Model interpretability**: Crucial for clinical adoption
4. **Data quality**: Handling missing values and noisy medical data

## Technical Implementation Strategy:

The project appears to use:
- **Transfer learning** with pre-trained CNN models for image feature extraction
- **Feature fusion** techniques to combine image and clinical data
- **Multiple model architectures** for comparison and ensemble
- **Comprehensive evaluation metrics** suitable for medical applications

This is a classic **medical AI prediction problem** that bridges computer vision and healthcare analytics, with significant potential real-world impact on patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
