## Problem Statement

### **Agricultural Challenge:**
Develop an automated system to classify potato leaf diseases using deep learning to help farmers quickly identify and treat plant diseases, thereby reducing crop losses and improving agricultural productivity.

### **Specific Objectives:**
1. **Disease Detection**: Classify potato leaves into three categories:
   - Early Blight
   - Late Blight  
   - Healthy

2. **Automated Diagnosis**: Create a CNN-based model that can accurately identify diseases from leaf images without requiring agricultural expertise

3. **Accessibility**: Provide an easy-to-use interface for farmers to upload images and get instant disease predictions

### **Technical Approach:**
- Use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification
- Implement transfer learning with pre-trained models (MobileNet, ResNet, etc.)
- Handle class imbalance in the dataset
- Optimize for both accuracy and computational efficiency

### **Key Data Characteristics:**
- Dataset contains images of potato leaves
- Three-class classification problem
- Potential challenges with varying image quality, lighting conditions, and leaf orientations
- Need to handle real-world agricultural conditions

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- High-accuracy classification model (>90% target)
- Deployable solution for farmers
- Reduced dependency on manual disease identification
- Early detection to prevent disease spread

### **Business Impact:**
- Minimize crop losses due to diseases
- Reduce pesticide misuse through targeted treatment
- Lower production costs for farmers
- Improve food security and agricultural sustainability

The project addresses a real-world agricultural problem using modern deep learning techniques, making plant disease diagnosis more accessible and efficient for farming communities.
